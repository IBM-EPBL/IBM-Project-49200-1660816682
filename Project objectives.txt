Wind energy plays an increasing role in the supply of energy wordThe energyoutput of a wind farm is highly dependent on the weather 
condition present at the windfarm.If the output can be predicted more accurately, energy suppliers can coordinate thecollaborative production 
of diﬀerent energy sources more eﬃciently to avoid costly overpro-ductions.With this paper, we take a computer science perspective on energy
 prediction basedon weather data and analyze the important parameters as well as their correlation on theenergy output. 
To deal with the interaction of the diﬀerent parameters we use symbolicregression based on the genetic 
programming tool DataModeler.Our studies are carried out on publicly available weather and energy data
 for a wind farmin Australia. We reveal the correlation of the diﬀerent variables for the energy output.
 Themodel obtained for energy prediction gives a very reliable prediction of the energy outputfor newly given weather data.
